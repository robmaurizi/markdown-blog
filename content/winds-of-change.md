Wow, so things are quite different around here lately. The last post on here is from February, 2013. Itâ€™s now October, 2018, and much has changed with the world.

To start, Iâ€™m no longer self-employed. I closed up shop last summer after losing the will to keep chasing clients for invoices (Iâ€™m not an accounting department), and having to hustle for work (Iâ€™m also not an sales/account guy). So I returned to what I really enjoyed, and that was just making websites.

I re-jiggered the old website here, going so far as to take WordPress 5 for a spin w/ Gutenberg and the new Twenty-Nineteen theme! I must say, Iâ€™m digging it so far ðŸ™‚

After playing with Gutenberg at work a bunch, I really got into it and I like the flowâ€”it even inspired me to want to start writing again, hence the cleanup here. Iâ€™m going to try to touch on topics around work, life, web dev, and whatever else comes to mind.
