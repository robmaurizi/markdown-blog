We’ve inherited my mom’s piano, so we need to offload our current piano. For those interested, here are some specifics & photos.

For your consideration: 1930’s Sterling baby grand piano. Approximately 4’6″ wide by 4’9″ long. Perfect for a smaller home, and ideal for a family with piano students.

The action was rebuilt in 1995 by Lindeblad Piano Restoration. We purchased the piano from the original owner in June, 2019 and since that time has undergone regular tunings & maintenance.

Asking ~~$800~~ your best reasonable offer.
