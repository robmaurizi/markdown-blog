After nearly 13 years in our house, we finally pulled the trigger on dealing with our backyard space. When we bought our house, there was this screened-in porch that was only accessible from the outside, and when we were doing repairs prior to moving in, we decided that we should frame a doorway so that we could eventually make the family room extend all the way to the back of the house.

Well, it very quickly became obvious that that was going to be a bigger project that we would want to deal with and we tabled it. Ideas about a deck or a patio kept resurfacing, but the funds weren’t there, so it kept going back to the back burner.

Well, finally this spring, we were able to put it together, and our back patio was born. With access from the kitchen, I no-longer had to navigate the gauntlet of shoes by the back door, or walk around the whole back of the house to get to the grill!

But one thing was missing, and that was the furniture. Fortunately, I enjoy hobbyist woodworking and got the okay from the Mrs. to build a patio table. I worked up some designs in SketchUp and we agreed upon a basic table with aprons. A quick lumber and cut list later and it was off to the lumber yard for some cedar!

![Every great project starts with a pile of lumber!](/images/building-a-patio-table/IMG_6456-1869x2048.jpg#!align=wide&width=1869&height=2048)

Eastern red cedar it was, and it smells like pencils! With the lumber in hand, the first task was to start on the frame. Legs & aprons. The legs were cut from 4×4 cedar posts, while the aprons are 2×4’s. I cut tenons on the ends of the aprons and chopped mortises in the leg blanks. Amazingly, I put all of the mortises in the right spots!

After a dry fit, the whole thing was a little too chunky for my taste, so to lighten the legs, I planed tapers on the two inside edges of each leg. I think they went from 3.5″ down to 2″ or 2.5″ square along the length of the leg, and they just felt much nicer.

Once I got into the groove, I could knock the tapers down in about a half our per leg (note, I’m using a #7 jointer plane, and not a band saw). I probably could have gotten it to go quicker had I first rough cut the waste away and then planed to finish, but I enjoy a GIGANTIC pile of shavings… Sometimes it makes standing in the shop that much more comfortable!

With the legs & aprons feeling right and fitting together, it was time to focus my attention on the top. The top is comprised of a frame and slats. The frame is made from 2×6’s with a rabbet cut into the top-side to receive the slats. The slats are just 1×4’s. This was more challenging than I had anticipated for several reasons. First off, cutting a rabbet 6 feet long by 2 or 3″ wide with hand tools is considerably more complicated than it sounds. I rough cut the rabbet with a rip saw and then plowed out the rest with an old wooden rabbet plane. Between trying to keep the saw on line and then keep the rabbet plane square to the stock, I’m lucky I got it done at all! The second bit of complexity was cutting the miters in the 2×6’s. Miters are always tricky business, but I figured I’d be able to make it easier with my miter saw. Power tools do have their advantages sometimes. This was not one of those times.

My miter saw can cross-cut a 2×6 very easily. But the 10″ blade in it isn’t nearly big enough once skewed to 45°, so I could only cut about 2/3 the way through. Fortunately, that was enough for the bit that would show, so I cut partial miters in each end of each piece of the top, then took to it with a cross-cut saw to finish the underside, making sure to cut at at least the 45° if not a little shallower so the miters would still look closed once it was all assembled. Close enough for shop work!

Either way, with the miters cut and the rabbets plowed, it was time to glue up the frame for the top. I opted to use dowels across the miters to help secure the joints. This seemed to work reasonably well and was certainly easier than trying to do some kind of hidden spline or something like that. With the help of all of my giant clamps and a couple of my kids, the glue-up went reasonably well.

With the tabletop frame cooking, it was time to measure and cut the slats that would make up the top. As mentioned above, these are 1×4 cedar planks. I was able to set my eldest to cutting these to lengths using the miter saw and he did a great job. Once they were all cut, it was time for a dry fit to make sure everything laid out properly.

With the top mostly out of the way, it was time to turn my attention back to the frame & legs. To this point, none of this had been glued up yet, but that was about to change. The glue-up was non-eventful. Again with the giant clamps and the big kids and the checking diagonals to ensure it was square, and we made it out the other end unscathed!

However, I was still nervous about my mortises & tenons, especially since this was going to live outside—I felt the joints needed a little something extra to help hold them together. I found a scrap of nice straight-grained white oak in my wood pile and split and shaped some pegs. With those in hand, I bored some holes into the legs through the tenons, dropped some glue in, and drove my new wooden nails home. Very satisfying indeed!

The whole process of making these was incredibly peaceful and satisfying. I recall Peter Follansbee once saying how after a long day at Plimouth Plantation, he would retire to the shop and make these to de-stress—I totally get that now.

We’re in the home-stretch now, as the legs & aprons are glued up, and the top is ready for action. I attached the slats to the top from the underside with coated deck screws, and the top was finally one piece! With the whole thing centered on the base, the final piece of the puzzle was buttons to attach the top to the base. I was going to try my hand at making them, but they just seemed too clunky, and I didn’t have a ton of room to work underneath, so I resorted to some table buttons from Rockler that I had left over from another project. These fit much better than anything I was going to cut from scraps.

The last step was finishing, and for that I went with a basic water sealer. I wanted to maintain the natural beauty of the cedar, but I didn’t want it to immediately start to weather, so a couple of light coats of deck sealer did the trick.

Given a day to fully dry, it was time to marry the years-long project of our patio with this couple-of-weeks-long project of a table and put her in position. I had drawn up plans for chairs & benches, but I didn’t want to hold things up for that, so I took some old bench tops that my brother had rescued from his kids’ old playhouse and attached some new legs to them, and voila, dinner could be served!

This patio and this table couldn’t have come at a better time either. We were all struggling with the coronavirus lockdown, I was mourning the death of my mom, and I just really needed something else to occupy my thoughts. Most of this was built on weekends, in the early morning hours before work, or in the evenings after dinner. There’s something very therapeutic about being in the shop on a gentle summer morning making something tangible come together from a stack of sticks. The heft of the plane, the hum of a handsaw, the smell of shavings—it transforms me to another world that I don’t mind spending some time in.
